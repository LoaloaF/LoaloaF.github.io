            Considering the effort going into a master thesis, it is unfortunate
            that it's read by only a few people. Understandably so. Who wants to
            read 40-60 pages of dry academic English? This text attempts to
            compress my work into a blogpost-like format that is accessible to a
            wider audience. The title was the last unnecessarily academically
            bloated thing, I promise.

            The brain represents information in electrical signals (probably;
            we’re not 100% sure). Tapping into those electrical signals is
            interesting for understanding how the brain works, and in which ways
            diseased brains fail to work. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Measuring electrical signals in the brain already works quite well.
            Research groups and companies like Elon Musk’s Neuralink put
            electrodes in the brain to record electrical activity. Why is this
            useful? Well, for example, if you lost an arm these signals can be
            used to control a prosthesis, greatly improving your quality of
            (cyborg) life.
